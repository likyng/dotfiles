dotfiles
==========

my dotfiles, more to be added soon, hopefully!
created on archlinux for archlinux! :)

todo
=====

- properly escape dovecot passwords, to allow e.g. ! etc
- if AwesomeWM is not installed, copy xinitrc but ask before. Then, if copying remove exec awesome and keep the old exec in xinitrc!
- add a list of packets which should always be installed for easier install of a new system!
